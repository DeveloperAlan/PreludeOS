# DeveloperAlan's PreludeOS
The janky carputer operating system for the 1992 Honda Prelude

## What
A carputer running on a Raspberry Pi hooked up to the car. Runs basic software such as Google Maps and Spotify on the Raspbian OS with a custom Electron/Rust application

## Why
The Honda Prelude is a funky looking car. I particularly love the dashboard of the 4th generation Honda Prelude

This gave me an idea to create an updated car interior experience. It seemed the car designers would like to have LCD screens on
the electronic dashboard at the time, but unfortunately didn't have the technology to.

Hence, the idea to create a modern dashboard on a forward thinking car of it's time was born.
